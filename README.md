# Enma

Enma is a Python library designed to fetch manga and doujinshi data from many sources. It provides a unified interface to interact with different manga repositories, making it easier to retrieve manga details, search for manga, paginate through results, and fetch random manga.

## :warning: Warning
> **:exclamation: Important: Enma is not intended for mass querying or placing heavy loads on supported sources. Please use responsibly, adhering to the terms of service of the data sources. Misuse may result in service disruption or access denial.**

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+

## Installation
```py
pip install --upgrade enma
```

Ensure you have the required Python version:
```py
import sys

package_name = "enma"
python_major = "3"
python_minor = "9"

try:
    assert sys.version_info >= (int(python_major), int(python_minor))
except AssertionError:
    raise RuntimeError(f"{package_name!r} requires Python {python_major}.{python_minor}+ (You have Python {sys.version})")
```

## Documentation

## Usage

### Example 1: Using Default Available Sources

```py
from typing import cast
from enma import Enma, DefaultAvailableSources, CloudFlareConfig, NHentai, Sort

enma = Enma[DefaultAvailableSources]()

config = CloudFlareConfig(
    user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
    cf_clearance=''
)

enma.source_manager.set_source(source_name='nhentai')
nh_source = cast(NHentai, enma.source_manager.source)
nh_source.set_config(config=config)

doujin = enma.random()
print(doujin)
```

### Example 2: Extending with Custom Sources
```py
from typing import cast
from enma import Enma, SourcesEnum, Manganato, IMangaRepository

class AvailableSources(SourcesEnum):
    NHENTAI = 'nhentai'
    MANGANATO = 'manganato'
    NEW_SOURCE = 'new-source'

enma = Enma[AvailableSources]()

enma.source_manager.add_source(source_name='new-source', source=Manganato()) # Source MUST be an instance of IMangaRepository
enma.source_manager.set_source(source_name=AvailableSources.MANGANATO)

manga = enma.random()
print(manga)
```

## Caching
Caching is a key feature in Enma that improves your application's efficiency by storing the results of data requests. This means when the same data is requested again, Enma can quickly retrieve it from the cache instead of repeatedly calling the external source. This results in faster response times and less strain on both your application and the external APIs.

### How Caching Benefits You
- **Speed**: Retrieving data from the cache is faster than making a new request to a manga repository.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of network requests, which is especially useful when dealing with rate-limited APIs.
- **Reliability**: Provides more consistent application performance even with varying network conditions.

### Customizing Cache Settings
While Enma provides default caching settings that suit most needs, you may want to customize these settings based on your specific requirements, like how often you expect data to change or specific API rate limits.

#### Adjusting Cache Duration via Environment Variables
You can control how long data is kept in the cache by setting environment variables. This allows you to fine-tune the balance between data freshness and retrieval speed without modifying the core library code.

For example, to change the cache expiration for fetching chapters, you can set the `ENMA_CACHING_FETCH_SYMBOLIC_LINK_TTL_IN_SECONDS` environment variable:

```sh
# Sets the cache duration to 30 minutes
export ENMA_CACHING_FETCH_SYMBOLIC_LINK_TTL_IN_SECONDS=1800
```

This customization capability ensures that you can adapt the caching behavior to best fit your application's performance and efficiency needs.

By leveraging caching, Enma helps make your manga-related applications faster and more reliable, all while giving you the flexibility to tailor caching behavior as needed.

#### Available Caching TTL Settings
| KEY                                            | DEFAULT |
|------------------------------------------------|---------|
| ENMA_CACHING_FETCH_SYMBOLIC_LINK_TTL_IN_SECONDS| 100     |
| ENMA_CACHING_PAGINATE_TTL_IN_SECONDS           | 100     |
| ENMA_CACHING_SEARCH_TTL_IN_SECONDS             | 100     |
| ENMA_CACHING_GET_TTL_IN_SECONDS                | 300     |
| ENMA_CACHING_AUTHOR_TTL_IN_SECONDS             | 100     |

## Downloading Chapters
Using Enma you're able to download chapter pages to your local storage or any other storage that implements `ISaverAdapter`.

You can check it out how to do it right below:

```py
from enma import (Enma,
                  CloudFlareConfig, 
                  ManganatoDownloader, 
                  Threaded, 
                  LocalStorage)

enma = Enma()
enma.source_manager.set_source('manganato')
manga = enma.get(identifier='manga-wb999684')

downloader = ManganatoDownloader()
local = LocalStorage()

if manga:
    enma.download_chapter(path=f'./download/{manga.title.english}',
                          chapter=manga.chapters[0],
                          downloader=downloader,
                          saver=local,
                          threaded=Threaded(use_threads=True,
                                            number_of_threads=5))
```

## Logger Control
By default Enma sets logs as `SILENT`. But if you're needing to see what Enma outputs you can set log mode as `NORMAL` or `DEBUG` to deep logs.

```py
from enma import logger, LogMode

logger.mode = LogMode.NORMAL
```

## Symbolic Links
Enma normally retrieves all information about a manga, including the pages of each chapter. This process can be slow if the manga has many chapters. To speed it up, you can use symbolic links when getting a manga. This way, Enma creates a SymbolicLink instead of fetching all data immediately. You can then use this link to quickly access and fetch data for a specific chapter later.

```py
from enma import Enma

enma = Enma()

enma.source_manager.set_source('manganato')
doujin = enma.get(identifier='manga-kb951984', with_symbolic_links=True)

if doujin is not None:
    chapter_ref = doujin.chapters[0]
    chapter = enma.fetch_chapter_by_symbolic_link(link=chapter_ref.link)

```

## Retrieving `user-agent` and `cf_clearance` for NHentai

To retrieve the `user-agent` and `cf_clearance` for NHentai:

1. **Open NHentai in your browser**: Navigate to the NHentai website.
2. **Open Developer Tools**:
    - **For Google Chrome**: Right-click on the webpage and select Inspect or simply press Ctrl + Shift + I (or Cmd + Option + I on Mac).
    - **For Firefox**: Right-click on the webpage and select Inspect Element or press Ctrl + Shift + I (or Cmd + Option + I on Mac).
3. **Navigate to the Network Tab**: In the Developer Tools panel, click on the Network tab. This tab captures all network requests made by the webpage.
4. **Reload the Page**: With the Network tab open, reload the NHentai website by pressing Ctrl + R (or Cmd + R on Mac). This ensures that all network requests are captured.
5. **Select the nhentai.net Request**: After reloading, you'll see a list of files on the left side of the Network tab. Click on the first file named nhentai.net. This represents the main request to the NHentai website.
6. **Find the Request Headers**: On the right side, you'll see several tabs like Headers, Preview, Response, etc. Make sure you're on the Headers tab. Scroll down until you find a section named Request Headers.
7. **Copy the user-agent and cf_clearance**:
    - **user-agent**: This is a string that tells the server which web browser is being used. Look for an entry named User-Agent and copy its value.
    - **cf_clearance**: This is a specific cookie set by CloudFlare for security purposes. Look for an entry named cf_clearance and copy its value.

![example](./docs/images/user-agent.png)
## Example:

```py
config = CloudFlareConfig(
    user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
    cf_clearance=''
)
```
> **Note**: The user-agent and cf_clearance values can change over time. If you encounter issues accessing NHentai through the Enma library, you might need to repeat the above steps to get updated values.
